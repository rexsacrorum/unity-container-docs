# Project state

The author of Unity Container and its sole contributor [passed away](https://www.gofundme.com/f/eugene-sadovoi). Therefore, the official project domain with documentation was expired and seized by cybersquatters.

Since I have to work with a legacy project that uses a Unity container, I decided to restore the documentation. 

I have no intention to maintain the project or to provide any support. I just want to make the documentation available to the community.
